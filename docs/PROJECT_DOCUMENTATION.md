# GCP Loan Data Processing Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end data processing pipeline for loan data using Google Cloud Platform services. The pipeline generates synthetic loan data, processes it using Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow, and stores the results in BigQuery for analysis. The pipeline categorizes loans into risk categories (Low, Medium, High) based on various factors such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.

The pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Data Generation**: A Python script generates synthetic loan data with different risk profiles.
2. **Google Cloud Storage**: The generated data is uploaded to GCS for processing.
3. **Apache Beam Pipeline**: The data processing logic is implemented using Apache Beam.
4. **Google Cloud Dataflow**: The Apache Beam pipeline is executed on Dataflow for scalable processing.
5. **BigQuery**: The processed results are stored in BigQuery for analysis.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Generation

The `generate_loan_data.py` script generates synthetic loan data with different risk profiles. The risk profiles are defined based on loan amount and interest rate ranges:

```python
# Risk profiles with loan amount and interest rate ranges
RISK_PROFILES = {
    'Low': {
        'loan_amount_range': (10000, 30000),
        'interest_rate_range': (3.0, 6.0),
        'probability': 0.2  # 20% of customers
    },
    'Medium': {
        'loan_amount_range': (20000, 50000),
        'interest_rate_range': (6.0, 10.0),
        'probability': 0.3  # 30% of customers
    },
    'High': {
        'loan_amount_range': (40000, 100000),
        'interest_rate_range': (10.0, 15.0),
        'probability': 0.5  # 50% of customers
    }
}
```

The script generates 500 loan records with a balanced distribution of risk profiles. Each loan record includes:
- Loan ID
- Customer ID
- Loan Amount
- Interest Rate
- Loan Term
- Issue Date

The data generation logic:

1. Assigns risk profiles to customer IDs based on defined probabilities
2. Generates loan amounts and interest rates within the ranges defined for each risk profile
3. Randomly assigns loan terms (12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 months)
4. Generates random issue dates within the past year
5. Writes the data to a CSV file

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline

The `loan_pipeline.py` script implements the Apache Beam pipeline for processing the loan data. The pipeline performs the following steps:

#### 2.1. Read Data from GCS

```python
lines = p | 'ReadFromGCS' >> ReadFromText(known_args.input)
```

#### 2.2. Parse CSV Lines

```python
def parse_csv(line):
    try:
        return next(csv.reader([line]))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error parsing line: {line}, Error: {e}")
        return None

parsed = lines | 'ParseCSV' >> Map(parse_csv)
```

#### 2.3. Filter Out Invalid Data

```python
parsed = parsed | 'FilterParsingErrors' >> Filter(lambda x: x is not None)
data = parsed | 'FilterHeader' >> Filter(lambda row: row[0] != 'loan_id')
valid_data = data | 'FilterInvalidLoans' >> Filter(lambda row: float(row[2]) > 0)
```

#### 2.4. Calculate Repayment and Risk Scores

The `calculate_repayment` function is the core transformation that:
- Calculates total repayment using simple interest formula
- Calculates monthly payment
- Calculates a credit risk score based on loan amount, interest rate, and term
- Categorizes loans into risk categories (Low, Medium, High)

```python
def calculate_repayment(row):
    try:
        loan_id = row[0]
        customer_id = row[1]
        loan_amount = float(row[2])
        interest_rate = float(row[3])
        loan_term = int(row[4])  # months
        issue_date = row[5]
        
        # Calculate total repayment using simple interest formula
        total_repayment = loan_amount * (1 + (interest_rate / 100) * (loan_term / 12))
        
        # Calculate monthly payment
        monthly_payment = total_repayment / loan_term
        
        # Interest rate is the primary driver of risk score
        if interest_rate <= 6.0:
            base_score = 780  # Low interest rates get higher base score
        elif interest_rate <= 10.0:
            base_score = 700  # Medium interest rates get medium base score
        else:
            base_score = 600  # High interest rates get lower base score
        
        # Adjust for term and amount
        term_factor = min(30, loan_term / 3)
        amount_factor = min(50, loan_amount / 2000)
        rate_factor = min(150, interest_rate * 12)
        
        credit_risk_score = int(base_score + term_factor - amount_factor - rate_factor)
        credit_risk_score = max(300, min(850, credit_risk_score))  # Ensure within FICO range
        
        # Determine loan status category
        if credit_risk_score >= 750:
            risk_category = "Low Risk"
        elif credit_risk_score >= 650:
            risk_category = "Medium Risk"
        else:
            risk_category = "High Risk"
            
        return (customer_id, (loan_amount, total_repayment, monthly_payment, credit_risk_score, risk_category))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error calculating repayment for row: {row}, Error: {e}")
        return None
```

#### 2.5. Aggregate Data by Customer

The `sum_loans_and_repayments` function aggregates data by customer:
- Calculates total loan amount, repayment, and monthly payment
- Calculates weighted average risk score
- Determines overall risk category
- Counts loans by risk category

```python
def sum_loans_and_repayments(values):
    total_loans = sum(loan for loan, *_ in values)
    total_repayments = sum(repayment for _, repayment, *_ in values)
    total_monthly_payment = sum(monthly for _, _, monthly, *_ in values)
    
    # Calculate average risk score weighted by loan amount
    weighted_risk_score_sum = 0
    for value in values:
        loan = value[0]  # loan_amount is the first item
        risk_score = value[3] if len(value) > 3 else 0  # risk_score is the fourth item if it exists
        weighted_risk_score_sum += loan * risk_score
        
    avg_risk_score = int(weighted_risk_score_sum / total_loans) if total_loans > 0 else 0
    
    # Determine overall risk category based on average score
    if avg_risk_score >= 750:
        overall_risk = "Low Risk"
    elif avg_risk_score >= 650:
        overall_risk = "Medium Risk"
    else:
        overall_risk = "High Risk"
        
    # Count loans by risk category
    risk_counts = {}
    for value in values:
        if len(value) > 4:  # Make sure we have a category
            category = value[4]  # category is the fifth item
            risk_counts[category] = risk_counts.get(category, 0) + 1
        
    low_risk_count = risk_counts.get("Low Risk", 0)
    medium_risk_count = risk_counts.get("Medium Risk", 0)
    high_risk_count = risk_counts.get("High Risk", 0)
    
    return (total_loans, total_repayments, total_monthly_payment, 
            avg_risk_score, overall_risk, low_risk_count, medium_risk_count, high_risk_count)
```

#### 2.6. Format Output for BigQuery

```python
def format_output(element):
    customer_id, (total_loans, total_repayments, total_monthly_payment, 
                 avg_risk_score, overall_risk, low_risk_count, 
                 medium_risk_count, high_risk_count) = element
    
    # Calculate debt service ratio (monthly payment to total loan ratio)
    debt_service_ratio = (total_monthly_payment * 12) / total_loans if total_loans > 0 else 0
    
    # Calculate loan-to-value ratio (simplified for this example)
    ltv_ratio = total_loans / (total_loans * 1.25)  # Assuming collateral value is 125% of loan amount
    
    # Current timestamp for the record
    processing_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    
    return {
        'customer_id': customer_id,
        'total_loans': total_loans,
        'total_repayments': total_repayments,
        'total_monthly_payment': total_monthly_payment,
        'avg_risk_score': avg_risk_score,
        'overall_risk_category': overall_risk,
        'low_risk_loans': low_risk_count,
        'medium_risk_loans': medium_risk_count,
        'high_risk_loans': high_risk_count,
        'debt_service_ratio': debt_service_ratio,
        'loan_to_value_ratio': ltv_ratio,
        'processing_timestamp': processing_timestamp
    }
```

#### 2.7. Write to BigQuery

```python
output | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> WriteToBigQuery(
    known_args.output,
    schema='\n            customer_id:STRING,\n            total_loans:FLOAT,\n            total_repayments:FLOAT,\n            total_monthly_payment:FLOAT,\n            avg_risk_score:INTEGER,\n            overall_risk_category:STRING,\n            low_risk_loans:INTEGER,\n            medium_risk_loans:INTEGER,\n            high_risk_loans:INTEGER,\n            debt_service_ratio:FLOAT,\n            loan_to_value_ratio:FLOAT,\n            processing_timestamp:TIMESTAMP\n            ',
    write_disposition=BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE,
    create_disposition=BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED
)
```

### 3. Running the Pipeline on Google Cloud Dataflow

The `run_dataflow.sh` script automates the deployment of the pipeline to Google Cloud Dataflow:

1. Sets up environment variables for authentication
2. Verifies that input data exists in GCS
3. Creates BigQuery dataset if it doesn't exist
4. Generates a unique job name
5. Runs the pipeline on Dataflow with appropriate parameters

```bash
# Set up environment variables
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$(pwd)/e2e-project-etl-cc9bf99bbb88.json"
PROJECT_ID="e2e-project-etl"
REGION="us-central1"
INPUT_BUCKET="loan-input-data-e2e-project-etl"
TEMP_BUCKET="dataflow-temp-e2e-project-etl"
DATASET="loan_data"
JOB_NAME="loan-pipeline-job-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Extract service account email from credentials file
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=$(jq -r '.client_email' "$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")

# Run the pipeline
python loan_pipeline.py \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID \
  --region=$REGION \
  --runner=DataflowRunner \
  --temp_location=gs://$TEMP_BUCKET/temp \
  --staging_location=gs://$TEMP_BUCKET/staging \
  --job_name=$JOB_NAME \
  --input=gs://$INPUT_BUCKET/loans.csv \
  --output=$PROJECT_ID:$DATASET.customer_loans \
  --service_account_email=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

## Development Process and Tool Calls

The development of this project involved several steps and tool calls:

### Step 1: Creating the Data Generation Script

First, we created a script to generate synthetic loan data with different risk profiles. The script needed to:
- Define risk profiles with different loan amount and interest rate ranges
- Generate a balanced distribution of loans across risk categories
- Output the data to a CSV file

```python
# Risk profiles with loan amount and interest rate ranges
RISK_PROFILES = {
    'Low': {
        'loan_amount_range': (10000, 30000),
        'interest_rate_range': (3.0, 6.0),
        'probability': 0.2  # 20% of customers
    },
    'Medium': {
        'loan_amount_range': (20000, 50000),
        'interest_rate_range': (6.0, 10.0),
        'probability': 0.3  # 30% of customers
    },
    'High': {
        'loan_amount_range': (40000, 100000),
        'interest_rate_range': (10.0, 15.0),
        'probability': 0.5  # 50% of customers
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Developing the Data Processing Pipeline

Next, we developed the Apache Beam pipeline to process the loan data. The key components of the pipeline were:
- Reading data from GCS
- Parsing and validating the data
- Calculating repayment amounts and risk scores
- Aggregating data by customer
- Writing results to BigQuery

The most critical part was the risk scoring algorithm in the `calculate_repayment` function:

```python
# Interest rate is the primary driver of risk score
if interest_rate <= 6.0:
    base_score = 780  # Low interest rates get higher base score
elif interest_rate <= 10.0:
    base_score = 700  # Medium interest rates get medium base score
else:
    base_score = 600  # High interest rates get lower base score

# Adjust for term and amount
term_factor = min(30, loan_term / 3)
amount_factor = min(50, loan_amount / 2000)
rate_factor = min(150, interest_rate * 12)

credit_risk_score = int(base_score + term_factor - amount_factor - rate_factor)
```

### Step 3: Setting Up GCP Resources

We created scripts to set up the necessary GCP resources:
- GCS buckets for input data and temporary files
- BigQuery dataset for storing results
- IAM permissions for the service account

### Step 4: Running the Pipeline

We ran the pipeline on Google Cloud Dataflow and verified the results in BigQuery:

```bash
# Run the pipeline
python loan_pipeline.py \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID \
  --region=$REGION \
  --runner=DataflowRunner \
  --temp_location=gs://$TEMP_BUCKET/temp \
  --staging_location=gs://$TEMP_BUCKET/staging \
  --job_name=$JOB_NAME \
  --input=gs://$INPUT_BUCKET/loans.csv \
  --output=$PROJECT_ID:$DATASET.customer_loans \
  --service_account_email=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

### Step 5: Analyzing the Results

Finally, we queried the results in BigQuery to verify the distribution of risk categories:

```sql
SELECT overall_risk_category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(total_loans) as avg_loan_amount 
FROM `e2e-project-etl.loan_data.customer_loans` 
GROUP BY overall_risk_category 
ORDER BY count DESC
```

Results:
```
+-----------------------+-------+--------------------+
| overall_risk_category | count |  avg_loan_amount   |
+-----------------------+-------+--------------------+
| High Risk             |   103 |  71562.56097087379 |
| Medium Risk           |    65 |  29759.84676923077 |
| Low Risk              |    14 | 21508.394285714287 |
+-----------------------+-------+--------------------+
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Balanced Risk Distribution

Initially, all processed loans were categorized as "High Risk" due to the risk scoring algorithm not being properly calibrated. We addressed this by:

1. Modifying the risk scoring algorithm to make interest rate the primary driver of risk
2. Adjusting the base scores for different interest rate ranges
3. Reducing the impact of loan amount and term on the risk score

**Before:**
```python
base_score = 600
term_factor = min(50, loan_term / 2)
amount_factor = min(100, loan_amount / 1000)
rate_factor = min(100, interest_rate * 10)
```

**After:**
```python
# Interest rate is now the primary driver of risk score
if interest_rate <= 6.0:
    base_score = 780  # Low interest rates get higher base score
elif interest_rate <= 10.0:
    base_score = 700  # Medium interest rates get medium base score
else:
    base_score = 600  # High interest rates get lower base score

term_factor = min(30, loan_term / 3)
amount_factor = min(50, loan_amount / 2000)
rate_factor = min(150, interest_rate * 12)
```

### Challenge 2: GCP Permissions

Setting up the correct permissions for the service account was challenging. We created a script to automate this process:

```bash
# Extract service account email from credentials file
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=$(jq -r '.client_email' "$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")

# Grant roles to service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/dataflow.worker"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/bigquery.dataEditor"
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data processing pipeline for loan data using Google Cloud Platform services. The pipeline successfully:

1. Generates synthetic loan data with different risk profiles
2. Processes the data using Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow
3. Calculates repayment amounts and risk scores
4. Aggregates data by customer
5. Stores the results in BigQuery for analysis

The final results show a balanced distribution of risk categories, with higher loan amounts generally categorized as higher risk, which aligns with typical lending practices.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more sophisticated risk scoring algorithms
2. Implement real-time processing using Pub/Sub
3. Create a dashboard for visualizing the results
4. Add more data validation and error handling
5. Implement data quality checks and monitoring
